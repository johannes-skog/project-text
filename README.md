## Transformer model from Pytorch Primtives and training on OOM Dataset using arrow 

This projects implements a transformer model from Pytorch Primtives. 

Datasets are setup using the MML (Masked Language Modelling) objective, the datasets are pushed to arrow file for handling of large OOM size datasets.
